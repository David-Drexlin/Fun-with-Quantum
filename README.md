# "Fun with Quantum" 
Is a growing colletion of Jupyter notebooks that highlight specific aspects of Quantum Computing that are interesting and/or fun.

Currently, it contains:
1. Quantum Coin Game

## Quantum Coin Game 
A quantum coin game that illustrates the power of quantum superposition and interference  - implemented by Jan-R. Lahmann using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org), [binder](https://mybinder.org) and [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Inspired by the TED talk of Shohini Ghose  
["Quantum computing explained in 10 minutes"](https://www.ted.com/talks/shohini_ghose_quantum_computing_explained_in_10_minutes) 

View - and play the game online, without any install - in Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JanLahmann/Quantum-Coin-Game/master?filepath=Quantum-Coin-Game.ipynb)


## Usage instructions for the RISE 

Some of the binder images in this repository automatically launch RISE, a Jupyter/IPython Slideshow Extension.  
Navigation is easy:

* "Ctrl -" and "Ctrl +" (or "command -", "command +") adjust the zoom level to fit the text to the browser window
* Use the right & left arrow keys to navigate through the slides 
* "Shift + Enter" executes the interactive cells (might need to click the cell, first)
* Execute the interactive cells on each slide ("In [1]:", etc)
* Interactive cells can be modified, if needed
* "X" at the top left exits the slideshow and enters the jupyter notebook interface
