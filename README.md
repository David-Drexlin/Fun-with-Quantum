# Quantum Coin Game 
A quantum coin game to illustrate the power of quantum superposition and interference  - implemented by Jan-R. Lahmann using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org), [binder](https://mybinder.org) and [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Inspired by the TED talk of Shohini Ghose  
["Quantum computing explained in 10 minutes"](https://www.ted.com/talks/shohini_ghose_quantum_computing_explained_in_10_minutes) 

View - and play the game online, without any install - in Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JanLahmann/Quantum-Coin-Game/master?filepath=Quantum-Coin-Game.ipynb)
