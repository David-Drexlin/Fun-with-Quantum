    "# Hardy's Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardy's Paradox nicely illustrates the fundamental difference of Quantum Mechanics and classical physics. In particular, it can be used to discuss the claim made by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (\"EPR\") back in 1935. They objected to the uncertainty seen in quantum mechanics, and thought it meant that the theory was incomplete. They thought that a qubit should always know what output it would give for both kinds of measurement, and that it only seems random because some information is hidden from us. As Einstein said: God does not play dice with the universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea and part of the source code for this tutorial was published in a previous version of the [Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/), in the (now removed) chapter [The Unique Properties of Qubits](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-textbook/blob/master/content/ch-states/old-unique-properties-qubits.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This variant of Hardy's Paradox is a relatively simple example for an entangled qubit state that couldn't be reproduced by a few classical bits and a random number generator. It shows that quantum variables aren't just classical variables with some randomness bundled in.\n",

    "It took until 1964 to show that they were wrong. J. S. Bell proved that quantum variables behaved in a way that was fundamentally unique. Since then, many new ways have been found to prove this, and extensive experiments have been done to show that this is exactly the way the universe works. We'll now consider a simple demonstration, using a variant of Hardy’s paradox."
